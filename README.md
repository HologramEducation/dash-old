Hologram Dash really old files provided for posterity's sake

## hologram_user_module_serial_gateway_0.6.bin
This is a really old version of the serial gateway user software sketch that used to come preloaded on early versions of the Dash. 

This has been superseded by the REPL that was preloaded on later versions of the Dash, which is way more powerful: https://github.com/HologramEducation/hologram-dash-arduino-examples/tree/master/dash_repl

However, if you're interested in using a simple serial gateway sketch, the latest version of it should be used instead of this really old version, and the latest can be found here: https://github.com/HologramEducation/hologram-dash-arduino-examples/tree/master/konekt_user_module_serial_gateway
